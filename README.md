# Caldera Mar
Modified Lego Universe servers using DLU.

Modified code on this fork adds the following functionality:

- Disabled Chat Filter.
- NPC Vendors selling unreleased items.
- Ability for gmlevel 0 to use /playanim.

Caldera Mar uses this fork for its Lego Universe Server.

The modifications above are only applied to the server and do not require a user install a patch to their client.

The Caldera Mar LU server also uses these mods:

- [NexusDashboard.](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/NexusDashboard)
- Frostburgh with restored questing content.
- Frostburgh Racing.
- Disabled Item Linking/Binding.
- New items and crux drops.
- Modified locale.xml.

The modifications listed here are introduced by a patch on both client and server.

Look to [Darkflame Universe](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) for installation instructions, and for setting up the server on Google Cloud: [guide](https://github.com/MasterEric/awesome-lego-universe/blob/master/server-setup/google-cloud-setup.md)
